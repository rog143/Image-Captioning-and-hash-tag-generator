# Image Captioning & Hashtag Generator

An AI-powered tool that automatically generates captions and relevant hashtags for images using the BLIP model from Salesforce.

## Features

- **Automatic Image Captioning**: Generates accurate descriptions of images using state-of-the-art BLIP model
- **Smart Hashtag Generation**: Creates relevant hashtags based on the image content
- **Context-Aware Suggestions**: Adds specialized hashtag groups for common themes (dogs, nature, activities)
- **Stop Word Filtering**: Removes common words to create concise hashtags
- **Combined Word Hashtags**: Generates both single-word and combined-word hashtag variations

## Technology Stack

- **Python 3.x**
- **PyTorch** (for deep learning backend)
- **Hugging Face Transformers** (for BLIP model)
- **Pillow (PIL)** (for image processing)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-captioning-hashtags.git
   cd image-captioning-hashtags
   ```

2. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install torch pillow transformers
   ```

## Usage

```python
from caption_hashtag_generator import generate_caption_and_hashtags
import cv2

# Load your image
img = cv2.imread("your_image.jpg")
img = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)

# Generate caption and hashtags
caption, hashtags = generate_caption_and_hashtags(img)

print("Caption:", caption)
print("Hashtags:", hashtags)
```

## Example Output

For an image of a dog playing in a park:
```
Caption: a dog is running in the park
Hashtags: #dogrunning #runningpark #dog #park #dogsofinstagram #puppylove #naturelover #outdoors #fitness #active
```

## Model Information

Uses the `Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base` model from Hugging Face:
- BLIP (Bootstrapped Language-Image Pre-training) model
- Fine-tuned for image captioning
- ~223M parameters
- Trained on large-scale image-text datasets
